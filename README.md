Description: This folder includes code to reproduce tables and figures for the manuscript titled "Designing multi-center individually randomized group treatment trials"
Authors: Guangyu Tong*, Jiaqi Tong, Fan Li
Files: This folder includes five files as follows:
 1. SIMILATION_1.R: Simulation code for designing multi-center individually randomized group treatment trials where both arms have patients nested within therapists.
 2. SIMILATION_2.R: Simulation code for designing multi-center individually randomized group treatment trials where only one arm has patients nested within therapists.
 3. FIGURE_2.R: Code to reproduce Figure 2 that numerically illustrates the efficiency gain when accouting for center-level correlation.  
 4. FIGURE_3.R: Code to reproduce Figure 3 that illustrates through simulations no additional power gain when the therapist-level and residual-level random effect variances are fixed.
 5. STPD.R: Code to illustrate the sample size calcualtion procedure using data from the STPD trial.
 6. CODA.R: Code to illustrate the sample size calcualtion procedure using data from the CODA trial.
